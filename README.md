This repo contains a simple example of how to perform HTTP connections to public services for fetching and handling data with the help of the Google Volley Package.

There are many ways of performing connections to the internet, all of them (mostly) are grounded via Client-Server communications, this is done with the help of the HTTP protocol.

## Data formats

In order to share data, the most used format is the JSON, this particular one provides a lot of benefits because it's language agnostic, light and is very easy to understand.

## Network Libraries

From a software perspective, a library is a code block coded by other developers that are ready to be used. This is great because you can only focus on developing apps. This product is tested and contains all the logic behind certain functionality.

By using network libraries we can abstract the whole logic of developing and performing HTTP connections to a server, this kind of libraries provides an internal API for making this easier.

## Google's Volley

This is network library developed by Google. It provides functionality to provide fast and efficient ways to parse data and images from the internet.

## App

Check the `MainActivity` file, it contains 3 examples for fetching String and JSON-based data.
